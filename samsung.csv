While the Galaxy S9 display might at first appear to be very similar to the Galaxy S8, there are many major display performance improvements. OLED is now a highly refined and mature display technology that has evolved into the highest performance displays for Smartphones. So instead of just focusing on pushing the OLED hardware performance levels higher for the Galaxy S9, Samsung has instead concentrated on significantly enhancing and optimizing the on-screen Absolute Picture Quality and Absolute Color Accuracy of the OLED display by implementing precision factory display calibration, moving the overall Galaxy S9 display performance up to Outstanding levels, and setting many new Display Performance Records, including Absolute Color Accuracy that is Visually Indistinguishable From Perfect, and almost certainly considerably better than your existing Smartphone, living room 4K Ultra or HDTV, Tablet, Laptop, and computer monitor based on our detailed Lab measurements, earning DisplayMate’s highest ever A+ grade.",False,True,0.9712

And I've gone looking on my wife's phone's Play Store for stuff (wanting us to have the same app for whatever reason, for example). Both stores are a bit crappy at times. Apple does curate theirs a bit better, but Google Play Services — a semi-hidden app that runs in the background of your Galaxy S9 — is constantly checking for malware and other badware. Google Play Services really is the unsung hero of Android. It's fighting fragmentation by sneaking new features in through the back door, so even if the OS isn't getting updated, Play Services keeps itself up to date and that can do a lot.

You should reconsider gaming on Android. I won't argue which one's better (because we seem to agree, and it's a moot point) but Samsung makes the best screens, and I feel you're just cheating yourself by not making the most of that beautiful screen.

Good luck with your new phone. I think I could be happy with an S9, but honestly I'd rather keep my iPhone 6s. I know the S9 is a little more powerful, but when S9 owners are upset that their phone isn't getting any more updates, the 6s will still be trucking along nicely.

This let me disable any app/service/package on my phone, including Bixby, Facebook, and other stuff (handily sorted into different categories, and a hand link describing with the thing you want to disable does etc).

Bixby Button Remapper that works. The downside to this one is that you can't disable Bixby with the above app. The free version I'm using gives you a large number of options to remap the button to. I use it to switch back to the last app I was using, for example.

864,98clq3,2018-08-18 15:46:33,1534607193,"&gt; But, it is indeed -current year- and the phone scene is a bit depressing, the note 8 has all the hardware features that i consider must-haves, and the pixels are missing a couple features that make them dealbreakers at their price level for me.  

&gt; I personally feel that after a day of work, most people who prefer stock android (i was one for six years!) can manage to downplay/reduce OEM skins in a way that's tolerable for them, but again, that's just my experience.  

Spot on.  I used to flash every single Android phone I bought (which was a lot, I was a real phone junkie back in the day, around the era of the Galaxy S3 and HTC One).  Slowly, the features I cared most about weren't a big deal anymore.  One big reason I used to flash stock was to enable wifi tethering, which most carriers would lock down back in the day.  Now, it isn't really needed.  It's included in my current unlimited plan, and I'm no long a broke newlywed with no home internet.  

Stock itself is still a little appealing, just for the smoothness/snappiness, but even then, I've had an S8+ running Samsung's version of android, and it really isn't too bad. I swore off of Samsung after the S4, because I just couldn't handle Touchwiz and all it's lag.  But by last year, Samsung's skin wasn't looking too bad anymore, and other than the abomination that is Bixby, I haven't been bothered much by Sammy's spin on Android.   

I slap Nova Launcher and some custom themes and kind of forget about Samsung.  Phones have finally gotten fast enough that the lag isn't very detrimental.  I get occasional hiccups, but it's NOTHING like the phones of 4-5 years ago.  So I sympathize.  Phone scene these days definitely isn't as exciting as it was back in the day.  But maybe I'm just in a different place in life.  I used to care about having peak permormance, and attempting to game and emulate and all that on my phone, but these days I just want to smoothly and easily make calls, send messages / email, take pictures, and consume media.  None of those things requires a revolutionary device by current standards.  Crap, did I just talk myself out of my Note 9 preorder? *No, no I did not*  ",False,True,-0.8076

870,98rgpb,2018-08-20 07:09:04,1534748944,"TLDR: Advice on Heart Rate Monitoring watches

(Samsung Gear Sport vs Garmin Vivoactive 3 ??)

&amp;#x200B;

The wearable/smartwatch industry is a minefield!

Unlike mobile phones/laptops/TV very few retailers seem to have functioning models on display so you can actually see the screen in action, and feel it's responsiveness.  


That being said, I'm in the market and finding myself increasingly frustrated.  


My **#1 priority** is continuous heart-rate monitoring. Seems ridiculous to have to stop mid run to take my HR. I want to glance at my watch and see what my HR is. - and preferably I'd love this to happen with the screen on (no delay).

&amp;#x200B;

I know a chest strap is most accurate - one of the reasons why the Vivoactive is a nice choice because it can be paired with a strap. And yes, I could go 'single function' watches like a Polar, but I figured maybe it was an opportunity to invest in a smart watch that can do both. I'm also female (small wrist) and hey, if I can get something pretty, why not go with that right?

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding is the Samsung Gear Fit 2 does continuous HRM, but Samsung support told me the Sport doesn't?? Which seems odd to me, can anyone confirm?

The Garmin Vivoactive is a pretty watch, and does most of what the Samsung does, but I cannot get any information about CHRM -  their support hasn't returned my email, and although I made a forum account, I can't log in to ask! - If the answer is ""it does - but only with the chest strap"" - then cool - I'll get one - but I just can't get answers anywhere.

However, recently they’ve actually been selling pretty advanced technology and state of the art features. 

A couple years ago, the iPhone had a worse screen, slower processor, worse camera, etc. than an Android phone. Today, the iPhone X has the fastest processor ever seen in a phone, a really good screen second to only Samsung, great camera but that’s just below a Google Pixel 2, great battery life. Not only that, it has the most advanced facial recognition sensor in a phone due to its ability to see depth and can’t be fooled by a mask or a picture. While $1000 seems expensive, that’s the same price as a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and slightly more expensive than a Pixel 2 XL. The AirPods you mentioned can connect automatically to your iPhone without setup required, automatically pause music when one is taken out, have gestures and more. Mac products are starting to be priced fairly too. A Linus Tech Tips video I saw broke down the price of the components of an iMac Pro which costs $5000 and found that it’s actually cheaper than buying the components themselves.

Apple today is much better than the Apple before and some products seem expensive still today, but if you compare them to similar products you’ll see they actually compete fairly well.",True,True,0.9744

960,9ewr7o,2018-09-11 11:38:41,1536665921,"Ive had my 6S for 3 years, not had a single problem. When my battery started going bad, Apple replaced it for free. Never had another issue. The only issue I’m having now with it is the mute switch doesn’t always work. If it weren’t for that, the phone would be in perfect shape. Planned obsolescence my ass.

If you want to talk about planned obsolescence, let me tell you a story of a Samsung product I used to own. I had a Gear Fit 2. Besides having terrible battery life, it was a fine product. I got a good deal on a new one a year ago, $130 on amazon. The last few months, it became harder and harder to charge. The contacts on the watch were wearing out. It finally got to the point where it wouldn’t charge anymore. So less than a year after I bought it, I called up Samsung to see if I could get it fixed. Customer service rep was very nice, said my watch was still under warranty, that my issue was a known problem and she’d put in a support ticket to get it fixed. I sent my watch in. Got an email a few days later saying they received it and it still said “covered by warranty.”

Now the fun part. A few days later, I get an email saying they’re requesting payment to have my watch fixed. They now say it’s not under warranty and it’ll cost $230 to fix. I got a deal at $130 but the retail price is still $180, far less than the repair quote. I called them back, and the first thing they say to me is “Instead if fixing it, how about we set you up with a new watch, we can upgrade you to a pro model, or even a Gear 3 if you want.” I just said I want my watch fixed, and I’m not paying $230 for it. They apologized and said they couldn’t help me there, but reiterated that there was a myriad of products that I could buy that would replace it. I just hung up.

You sir, are a fan boy. I’m not brand loyal to Apple and was actually considering getting a Galaxy or Note until I realized how shitty Samsung actually is. All the “shady” business practices that fanboys like you accuse Apple of, I’ve yet to experience in 8 years of iPhone ownership. But the one Samsung product I buy, I see pretty much everything Apple gets accused of. I’ve considered my options and in my experiences, Apple makes a superior product with superior customer service.

let us remap the Bixby button

dual front facing speakers

faster updates

 better facial recognition (on par with Face ID, combined with iris scanner would be cool)

better camera processing (camera processing is what makes the Pixels' cameras so good)

easier repairability

less curves

compatibility with S-Pen

more optimization

Hi!

I'm  in a process of buying a gift (smartwatch) for my girlfriend and I am  after some advice. Here are some rough facts just to begin:

* price range: 200 - 300 EUR
* looks are (most) important (duh!)
* this will be her first smartwatch, she is using Android phone (no Apple Watches)
* health tracking has priority over fitness stuff, wrist HR is a must
* in-built GPS is nice, but not absolutely necessary
* usage: activity monitoring, sleep monitoring, walking, hiking, running ... nothing particularly sporty (for now)

Looking at currently known stuff to me, I found 3 candidates so far (based on looks):

1. Suunto Fitness 3 Gold
2. Garmin vivoactive 3 White with Rosegold Hardware
3. Samsung Galaxy Watch Rose Gold 42mm

I  know she likes the appearance of Fitness 3 Gold, so I started from  there. It lacks GPS, but otherwise looks like a nice candidate. I like  vivoactive 3 not only because of in-built GPS, but also because of  smaller height (11.7mm) ... this should be nice for her small wrists.  However, display/user interface is not really eye-catching to me. Galaxy  Watch seems to be the most advanced of them, but I am a bit worried for  battery life of 42mm variant.",False,True,0.9807

No. The iPhone X SoC was faster than the Note 9's despite coming out a year earlier. That's how badly Apple has obliterated the competition on the SoC front which is exactly what I'm saying. There was a specific test that you're mentioning that the Note 9 competed at, mostly because of iOS 11's iPhone X woes.

And before iPhone 7, most rating sites noted that iPhone 5s to 6s was not ip rated but would last in water fairly well. So that’s just a wrong statement. IP68 is the highest rating any phone or case has that I’ve seen. Is there a android phone with better?

The drop tests on the new XS show that its glass screens are pretty damn durable, so again not “built to break” (which I’m sure Samsung and Pixel does as well - but this is to say nothing is more “built to break” because, again, they’re equal here).

And again, the majority of parts inside are highly the same parts as in Samsung or pixel. Modems from intel or Qualcomm. Other parts from Samsung. So if “Samsung lets you order the parts” then you could order that same part for your iPhone. Screen repair? I can get one from the kiosk at the mall for any phone, android or iPhone. Unless you need a new fingerprint sensor. But of course 3rd party fingerprint sensors would be plenty damn stupid to allow on the market. Those are the security devices that control my iTunes and Apple Pay! I don’t want just anyone touching that, and neither does Apple. 

Apple isn’t dying. It just had its most profitable quarter ever. They sold almost as many devices for over $200 more per device. That’s a sign of market control, not loss. The A12 processor is unique in the industry (some say a whole generation ahead of Qualcomm processors in android). So yeah, Apple isn’t going anywhere and the data back it up. Samsung just turned a small loss in their mobile phone division. Google’s profits aren’t from android nor pixel. So I think the major players are all here to stay. 

Bonus content not related to your reply:
Android phones are far more likely to disallow updates than iPhones. iPhone 5S (6 years old) still gets and runs the latest iOS.

I answered your question directly.  There were many retailers including Amazon that had induction chargers out from several different makers. 

The reason you see more iphone cases at Target than anything else, is because Apple has the largest single company share of the smartphone market in the **US** (40%), but globally about 12%.  Other than Samsung, it would be foolish for Target to stock for the many different brands.  Search ""smartphone wireless charger"" on Amazon and see what you get.  I would say Samsung popularized wireless charging and large format phones that Apple fought against for so long.  I remember Apple saying ""people don't want large phones"".  Any phone with induction coils can use an induction charger.  It doesn't have to be made by Samsung or Apple.

Of course Apple globally popularized the smartphone, and the first iPad tablet 2010. But the tablet goes way back over 30+ yrs, but yes, Apple made it popular worldwide, and still holds about 28% market share of tablets.  The first tablet I remember was the GridTab in 1989. The guy who developed that, went on to develop the Palm Pilot.  They were expensive, and the average Joe homeowner didn't need one or justify the cost.  But a lot of businesses used them. All computers were expensive back then.  I bought a MAC II in 88, and it cost me $6800 if I remember right.",True,True,0.9415

I think that is a more than reasonable price. $1000 would even be fine for this spec. 

But coming from apple to android is really best done on a pixel. The pixel 1 is still an awesome choice for a phone, same for the pixel 2.
