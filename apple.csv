Intel's firmware updates appear to be reducing performance fairly significantly in various situations including ssd performance particularly.

Everyone uses speculative execution, what makes Intel so susceptible is cheaping out on when they discard prefetched instructions (allowing them to be read before being thrown away as they should be rather than throwing them away immediately when they should be) is what makes them vulnerable to meltdown while AMD aren't at all, and lack of security features in where they keep certain things in memory is what makes them so vulnerable to spectre type 2 attacks, again something not applicable to AMD.

Implementation of the same feature is what makes Intel by far the most compromised of all chip makers. AMD are barely touched, ARM made recent changes on the latest arch that made meltdown possible on their chips... so they'll probably have to make some large architecture changes to.

&gt;It's literally in Qualcomm's BSPs and incase you've been living under a rock for the last decade, they own roughly 50% of the mobile market. I'd be really fucking surprised if MediaTek and Samsung didn't have the exact same features too since they compete head to head with Qualcomm and often get design wins for the same products in other religions. 

OS versions with new code to regulate performance to keep NEW devices in spec, isn't the same as a new OS upgrade to an existing device that degrades performance.  

E.G.  

A device launched with Android 6, keeps its performance throughout the year, and when upgraded to Android 7 the device at _least_ keeps similar performance, often _increasing_ performance. 

Apple has the opposite effect, with older devices constantly reported to slow down with each new OS upgrade. Now three different country's governments want answers, from the US, China and France.

Curious how laptops running MAc OS, Linux, and Windows don't seem to have performance regressions with upgrading the OS ?

 Although Macbooks have had trouble from purchase day with batteries, but more on that later.

Jesus, now you're being facetious ?  

Either you have to concede that Apple is admitting fault, or you have to concede Apple's devices from iPhone 6 onwards were faulty to not even maintain performance for a single year.

Apart from the couple of non-Apple devices i've ceded to have performance issues, you've said this problem existed for 5+ years, yet for 100's of devices from phones, to tablets, and laptops, where is the data for performance regressions like the iPhones ?  


Apple's admission of _""battery life problems""_ says it right here: 

https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/

An iPhone that's $700 to $1,000+, isn't able to function within advertised performance specs after just a year of use, that's unacceptable, and either a design flaw, or planned obsolescence.  

&gt;**I'm not your personal researcher** and I got out of Android systems development for a reason. I only linked you because I remembered roughly where it was. Do your own research

You make an assertion, you support it with data, else your assertion is baseless. My only obligation is to support my own argument, not yours.  

Do your own research for your own argument.  

  

&gt;&gt;You missed the point. Apple's phone did NOT regain full performance under a ""full charge"", yet other devices do. This is the entire point of ""degraded performance"".

&gt;Yes it does. When the system thinks the battery capable of delivering the current

&gt;From apple themselves state:

&gt;With the update, iOS dynamically manages the maximum performance of some system components when needed to prevent a shutdown.

No, Apple's iPhones did not regain 100% of their advertised performance when the new OS updates launched, that's the problem, and why the **US Senate Commerce Committee, the French Government _and_ Chinese Government** want Apple to explain the device slowdown.

Considering there are ~1.2 Billion non Apple PC's and 2+ Billion non-Apple phones and tablets, it's strange to notice the lack of devices with what you say is the _""same problem""_.

Why are three different countries investigating Apple's product problem with regression, and yet _not_ investigating the many more devices from many other OEM's?

 Is it a conspiracy to keep Apple down, or is Apple actually the only one suffering the issue ?  

&gt;This is a physical chemistry problem.  Apple, at least right now, uses pretty much the exact same battery chemistry and packaging as everyone else.

A _""physical chemistry problem""_ of rebooting and regressed performance that no other phone, tablet, or laptop suffers. 

You claim it the same problem exists in plenty of devices in the last 5+ years, and yet where's the data for the 100's of products that apparently suffer this problem ?

&gt;Android is really just one huge pile of shit but if you feel like diving deeper freel free to report back. 

Odd, for such a _""pile of shit""_ and 100's of devices, not to mention every laptop, these devices don't seem to suffer the same _""physical chemistry problem""_ you say they do. 

Strange also that Apple's Macbooks have been having battery issues for years. You say every company uses _""the exact same battery chemistry and packaging as everyone else""_, so why is Apple demonstrably incompetent at designing products with them ? 

https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/12/apples-macbook-pro-battery-problems-are-getting-embarrassing/  

https://www.extremetech.com/computing/261988-apple-macbook-standby-battery-life 

Apple's solution at one point was to remove the estimated battery life left, which solves not the problem for the user, but attempts to make the issue go away in the media. If Android is _""a pile of shit""_, what does this make Apple ?  

It's a pity you couldn't demonstrate any other phone, tablet, or laptop, save the couple i ceded, among 100's of products in the last 5+ years that you assert apparently have the same problem.

That you want me to make your own argument and _""do the research""_ for you says a lot too.

It's literally in Qualcomm's BSPs and incase you've been living under a rock for the last decade, they own roughly 50% of the mobile market. I'd be really fucking surprised if MediaTek and Samsung didn't have the exact same features too since they compete head to head with Qualcomm and often get design wins for the same products in other religions.

&gt; Not to mention Apple already ""apologising"" for the problem. Their behaviour is no different than ""Antenna gate"", where people like you, and Apple, tried to ignore the issue with Apple phones, where iPhones were literally dropping alles (not just degraded signal).

An apologies don't imply fault, even legally. ""Sorry your father died"" doesn't imply I killed your father. 

The context in which that appears is clearly not apologizing for having pushed the patch. 

*We‚Äôve been hearing feedback from our customers about the way we handle performance for iPhones with older batteries and how we have communicated that process. We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down. We apologize. There‚Äôs been a lot of misunderstanding about this issue, so we would like to clarify and let you know about some changes we‚Äôre making.*

The emphasis is clearly on communication. 

&gt; If you are happy to reference other phones, tablets, laptops, etc having aftermarket patches that degraded performance, i'm happy to look at it.
So far you haven't demonstrated anything to suggest, bar the conceded couple of phones, any other devices over your proposed ""5+ years"" timespan, which would include 100's of devices.

I'm not your personal researcher and I got out of Android systems development for a reason. I only linked you because I remembered roughly where it was. 

Do your own research. 

&gt; You missed the point. Apple's phone did NOT regain full performance under a ""full charge"", yet other devices do. This is the entire point of ""degraded performance"".

Yes it does. When the system thinks the battery capable of delivering the current 

From apple themselves state:

*With the update, iOS dynamically manages the maximum performance of some system components when needed to prevent a shutdown.* 

And I've also verified this personally on my parent's 3 year old iPhone 6+ with about 800 cycles and 83% design capacity at 80% and 60% charge.

Someone on ycombinator also grepped the ioregs for symbols and found the following symbols which gives a pretty good idea of what they've exposed.
 
*iPad:~/ root# ioreg -l -w0 | grep Capacity | | | | | ""Capacity"" = 960 | | ""BootCapacityEstimate"" = 87 | | ""BatteryData"" = {""CycleCount""=232,""MaxCapacity""=10639,""FullAvailableCapacity""=11085,""StateOfCharge""=98, ""MfgData""=&lt;redacted cuz it looks like a unique id&gt;, ""DesignCapacity""=11560,""QmaxCell0""=11678,""Flags""=1,""ManufactureDate""=""6205"",""ChemID""=4384,""BatterySerialNumber""=""redacted"",""Voltage""=4155} | | ""CurrentCapacity"" = 10500 | | ""BootBBCapacity"" = 10364 | | ""AppleRawCurrentCapacity"" = 10242 | | ""AbsoluteCapacity"" = 11272 | | ""AppleRawMaxCapacity"" = 10489 | | ""MaxCapacity"" = 10500 | | ""DesignCapacity"" = 11560*

&gt; So you're describing normal battery usage, yet the difference is other devices DON'T have Apple's problem.

This is a physical chemistry problem. Apple, at least right now, uses pretty much the exact same battery chemistry and packaging as everyone else.

There's really nothing special here. You give them too much credit.

&gt; Are you describing the difference between different Android devices released with different Android versions that WEREN'T patched after market with degraded performance, or Apple's way of patching the phone aftermarket?

I know that they improved it in their BSPs but not sure what devices shipped with what and when. Android is really just one huge pile of shit but if you feel like diving deeper freel free to report back. 

&gt; That's the difference that you seem unable, or unwilling, to recognise. So if you have something to support your claim other devices over the last 5+ years were patched aftermarket, resulting in degraded performance, then i'm happy to see it.

If you'd been nicer or done some research yourself I'd have considered asking some of my Android friends or digging a bit further but frankly I really can't be bothered rn if you can't be.

You claimed other Linux and Qualcomm devices were suffering, are you saying you weren't talking about other phones and tablets running Android ? what other devices were you talking about then ? 

&gt;Again, I can agree that this may be an outlive in terms of the degree to which the update increased the aggressiveness of the governor at lower headroom; but in terms of the uniqueness of the solution, the uniqueness of tweaking this via an OTA update, and the degree in which throttling is occurring -- absolutely not. 

If you are happy to reference other phones, tablets, laptops, etc having aftermarket patches that degraded performance, i'm happy to look at it.

You missed the point. Apple's phone did NOT regain full performance under a ""full charge"", yet other devices do. This is the entire point of _""degraded performance""_.  

&gt;Yes. That's just how lithium batteries work.   

In other devices, yes, in Apple's, no.  

&gt;They only last for around 500 cycles under typical conditions and usage patterns. If you use it a higher temperatures, routinely deep discharge and/or leave your phone at extremely low charges for long periods - your battery may age quicker. 

So you're describing normal battery usage, yet the difference is other devices DON'T have Apple's problem.   

So what's the differentiator here, the batteries you claim are the problem that every other device somehow manages to NOT throttle, or is it really Apple's processor and battery design that couldn't cope with advertised specs and hence the aftermarket patch to throttle the device ?  

&gt;And that reminds me of when some Qualcomm devices received patches to throttle the processor to smooth out power consumption but for thermal reasons.

86,7q6qir,2018-01-13 19:49:42,1515872982,"No, I never said there are no other high end devices. I simply said that Apple was the industry leader in most of those areas. It's debatable which is why I said most, they're usually top 1 or 2 from an integrations standpoint so I think it's relevant. 

I think you also misunderstand my point regarding competitor devices. Qualcomm, MediaTek and other component suppliers supply both the high as well as the extreme low end of the market. They also provide component for a whole host of other applications and that combined experience lets them lead on these types of issues.

Further, I did not say that Apple is the only ""leader"" that requires an aggressive power governor. In fact my point was the exact opposite - that this is a pretty industry standard solution and has been for years. 

What makes this situation more pronounced, and why it got so much traction was because Apple - and not Android as you appear to have understood - have never needed as aggressive of a power governor until the last year or two when the power consumption in the other subsystems caught up and necessitated these changes.

Again, I can agree that this may be an outlive in terms of the degree to which the update increased the aggressiveness of the governor at lower headroom; but in terms of the uniqueness of the solution, the uniqueness of tweaking this via an OTA update, and the degree in which throttling is occurring -- absolutely not.

Also per your earlier comments... 

&gt;if you take your electric car analogy, how do you explain that charging the car battery to full would regain full throttle/power ?

If you charge your iPhone, higher current capacities will be available to the system. How much higher will depend on the condition of your battery.

&gt;Charging the Apple iPhone with this issue does not regain full processor to full performance, and the battery is barely ONE year old.
&gt;Are you saying the battery is already EOL'd after such short time ?

Yes. That's just how lithium batteries work. They only last for around 500 cycles under typical conditions and usage patterns. If you use it a higher temperatures, routinely deep discharge and/or leave your phone at extremely low charges for long periods - your battery may age quicker. 

It's also important to note that while charge capacity correlates with current capacity and state of charge, there's fairly significant variance between devices owing to their respective history of use.  

http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/types_of_lithium_ion
http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries

&gt;This issue is because Apple's processor has such spikes in demand, much more so than practically all other mobiles, laptops, etc, that the battery needs to be able to meet this power demand.
Sprint to sleep is just how everything works now due to dark silicon/current leakage. Modern U/M-Series Intel cores have similar characteristics along with Qualcomm and Nvidia's mobile processor range (though Apple does tend to go with much bigger chips) and desktop/server chips aren't far behind -- so no, this isn't really unique to Apple.

And that reminds me of when some Qualcomm devices received patches to throttle the processor to smooth out power consumption but for thermal reasons.

But yeah, if you want to call it a design fault that's your prerogative but IMO that would extend it to so many devices it pretty much loses all punctuation as far as this issue is concerned.",True,False,0.741
87,7q6qir,2018-01-13 19:49:42,1515872982,"i was expecting as such but wanted to wait first.  

Thee's a difference between Linux patches for generally handling processor and battery specs, and applying an OEM patch that degrades performance AFTER purchase.    

Energy Aware Scheduler is another example of refining granular processor and battery management, but that's not an example of a ""problem"" that needed to be fixed post purchase that would degrade performance.  

Again, you have not shared evidence that Apple's problem, is something other mobiles, tablets, laptops,l etc have suffered.

&gt;As for why we don't notice more often, most people technically inclined to work in the area understand the issues at hand and appreciate the solutions.   

This literally makes no sense, are you claiming these people know of performance degradation and ""accept it"" ?  

&gt;This kind of upgrade regression will also tend to only affect parties that actually update their devices which most OEMs are not particularly known for.  

over 5+ years you said, and yet 100's of phones, tablets, laptops, etc later not even half-a-dozen reports of the same problem documented in devices ?  

&gt;As well, this current limit issue on particular is pushed forward by peak power and therefore far likelier to affect higher end devices which have bigger, brighter, higher resolution displays; as well as cameras and bursty processors.  

again, 5+ years, 100's of devices, plenty of _""higher end devices""_ and barely a peep of the problem ?  

&gt;Apple, being the industry leader in most of those areas checked all the boxes for risk factors and **due to earlier system efficiency, just never needed as aggressive of a power governor** until it ran into the wall.  

Ignoring your false equivalence that Apple's devices somehow are the only ones that ""qualify"" for high end devices, as if no other _""higher end devices""_ existed over 5+ years, are  you admitting Apple's design fault ?

&gt;Android OEM/ODMs/Suppliers also often produce devices which are far less efficient, and more cost conscious and as a result run into these issues sooner and therefore iterate sooner.

  

So you want us to believe Apple is the only company that needed an _""aggressive power governor""_, while you simultaneously claim other OEM's suffer the same problem over 5+ years too ?

10S to me seems like an ultra cut down version that OEMs can include for practically nothing so Microsoft can do an in-place upgrade and have the customer pay for the license instead. 

For those who don't want to upgrade, you are locked to the windows store where they can get a cut of any sales. There are a number of strategic advantages to this solution; if 10S becomes popular enough, the developers will port their programs to UWP.

251,7tahic,2018-01-27 04:57:17,1517029037,"&gt;This is true, for a cost. (and if DIY, taking a risk)

Same goes for everything.If you don't know what you're doing, you pay a professional to do it for you. You don't complain when you pay $100 to a plumber to unclog your drain or a car mechanic to change your timing belt, why complain if you have to pay a professional to fix your phone?

&gt;And in ""the old days"", phones were cheaper than they are today.

Phones from the old days are not comparable with modern smartphones. A smartphone is essentially a computer that you have with you at all times. For many people it's actually more important than their laptop or desktop PC. This is actually one of the reasons why people constantly complain about the battery life of smartphones, because back in the day you wouldn't be constantly glued to your ""dumb"" phone browsing facebook or watching Youtube. You would only make phone calls, send texts and maybe snap a couple of photos, but not too many because that 32mb microsd card couldn't hold very much and the quality was crap anyway. 

&gt;And few (if any) were android users. They didnt need to.

Any phone with a glass screen is prone to breaking. If I fixed more iPhones than anything else, it's because iPhone screen swaps are actually more affordable than other phones. For an iPhone (except the iPhone X), a screen swap is less than 10% of the retail value of the phone. A screen swap for a galaxy S7 edge or S8 is more than 35-40% of the retail value of the phone. For many low end models it's sometimes more expensive to swap the screen than just buy a new phone, so we didn't even touch phones that sold under $300.

&gt;Disagree strongly. iPhones bend. A rigid replaceable battery would add strength.

That's mostly a problem for iPhone 6 and especially 6 plus. They improved the alloy in the 6s. I've mostly seen bent 6 pluses and maybe a couple of bent 6s, and I'm saying this as someone who has touched more than 1000 iPhones with various problems.

&gt;I think thats reaching a bit. May have happened, but its definitely not the reason they dropped the idea.

It would have definitely happened very often if these batteries were user replaceable. It's much easier to puncture a battery with a thin shell than you think.  

&gt;As you would know, dropped / cracked screen repairs are more common that water damage.

A cracked screen is also a less costly repair than a water damaged phone. If you come to me with an iphone with a cracked screen, I can fix it in ten minutes, but if you come with a water damaged phone, I could spend hours trying to clean the logic board and replace ICs and it's still a good possibility than it won't work. Even if it does, I can't give you any warranty for that repair, because there's a good chance the phone can randomly die within days, weeks or even months after the repair. The only sure way to fix a water damaged phone is to replace the entire logic board, but at that point you're better off just buying a new one.

&gt;You're right in that it frees them some design considerations, but in the end, it's always going to be about what is best for them, not you.

Just like any other kinds of companies in a capitalist society, phone manufacturers are just about supply and demand. If there will be demand for phones with user-swappable batteries, there will be phones to fill that demand. Currently, there is simply no demand for something like this, especially in the high end phones market. People want more features, better cameras, faster processors etc. I remember there was a start up that made some smart watch that had one week of battery life, but no one gave a fuck because they had compromised too much on other features (it had a monochrome screen, lol). In the end they ended up being bought by Fitbit, for like $15 million, which is basically spare change in this industry. 

&gt;But I suspect $1000 phones will slowly continue to be a thing, and I suspect more and more people will start to question whats really going on.

Honestly, IMO, the only kinds of people who buy $1000 phones are either so wealthy that $1000 isn't a lot to them, either they are idiots. Probably, there are more idiots than wealthy people, but you get the idea. More affordable phones are almost as good as flagships and flagships from last year or even 2-3 years ago are still very capable phones. For example, I recently upgraded my iphone 6s to an iphone 7, but not because the 6s was getting slow or anything, only because the I had the 16G version and it was a pain in the ass. I sold my 6s for ‚Ç¨270 and got a 7 128GB in pretty much mint condition for ‚Ç¨400. I would never pay ‚Ç¨1200 or whatever they charge for the iPhone X in my country, even though I could easily afford it. You can get really good deals if you don't have wet dreams about cutting the seal on the box of a brand new flagship. ",True,False,0.9822

- I write small and fast. Even though the canvas is of the right size, the ink feels like if it can't catch up with my writing. A tiny bit of this might be because the tip isn't ""rigid"" but ""soft"".

With this being said, with iPad's (as I briefly mentioned earlier) I can write exactly as if it was a piece of paper. Perhaps the Surface 2017 became better, with its new Pen and technologies?

In conclusion, I must admit that MY writing habits make fast writing unpractical; or better, very unsatisfying. I have friends who more or less like it.

The screen is what I was really after. Didn't really care much about any of the other stuff, even though neat. These phones should have had OLED displays generations ago. FaceID was annoying as fuck. I bought the phone and set it all up, then got a haircut the next day, which involved trimming a rather large amount of my beard, then faceID stopped working. Had to reprogram it. I hated that I had to pick up the phone and point it in a specific direction to get it to unlock. Unlocking while sitting on the counter at arm's reach became near-impossible unless you stood directly over it and looked straight down. Apple support swore it shouldn't be such a problem, but it was. I then realized that in order to unlock my phone while snowboarding, I'd actually have to remove my mask AND goggles, or use passcode. The swipe-up gesture for going home when the phone was in landscape mode was iffy, especially when video was being played. Same with portrait mode with video played. Sometimes would have to do it 4 or 5 times.  Again, making me wish there were a home button with touchID. I even tested this on an X at Costco the other day that had been updated to iOS 11.2.5, and it still had the issue. The inability to show battery percentage without a gesture into control panel is dumb. Lots of the issues I had were software related, but I didn't really see the value in the extra price, nor did I see how it was that much better than my 7. I've purchased every iPhone since the 4 (except the 4s) the moment I was able to preorder. I'm one of the people who stays up until 1am in order to ensure first access to every new iPhone. I'm a die hard Apple fan. But in the end, the one thing I hated most was faceID. I won't buy another iPhone that only has FaceID. Neat as a supplement, but not as the primary method of unlocking. I gave it a fair chance. Had it for about a week, but I was over the issues after just a couple days.

Overall, I do think I prefer iOS to Android, but I don't like it enough to spend 2x the money. Honestly, I wish Windows Phone was still around because I found it to be the ideal balance between Android's flexibility (even despite the lackluster app selection) and iOS's refinement and stability.

Another alternative is buying a cheap Android phone to use as a media consumption device. Not only would it serve as a media consumption device, but as a backup phone, too. The only drawbacks are price, and having to lug two phones around with you.

Pluses include playback of virtually every music file out there, and plenty of audio mods like Viper4Android.

I don't currently own any Apple products (nor do I want any at this time), but I don't disagree with the notion that generally, they tend to be of higher quality than their competitors. You can probably agree that just 5-7 years ago, there were no (or very few) Windows laptops that matched the craftsmanship/longevity of the MacBook Pro.",True,True,-0.2779
573,80mgyi,2018-02-27 13:37:36,1519738656,"I agree it was the case several years ago for laptops and maybe even phones.
Today, Windows laptops (ultrabooks) are better designed, offer even more features (and ports), are often faster, lighter, smaller with better battery life and keyboards  and are... less expensive.

That's an objective and factual observation. 

So, when tech media like The Verge (but many others like Tech Crunch, Phone Arena, CNet etc...) give higher ratings and better reviews to MacBooks ... And  are giving constant praise to Apple products, the only possible explanation is bias.

As for phones. Beside the new X Design (which is different and can be preferred by some, why not? They like notches? And I won't even talk of the 3 years of the same design... 4 for the regular one this year), almost everything you can think of is better on Android (even security, contrary to what most people think.. At least it's debatable, really. You can read [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/80o38i/smartphone_security_update_availability_report/) for example... 

The amount of things you *can't* do (because of how limited on purpose it is) with iOS (devices) should be way too much to even consider it/them as on par with Android (ones), let alone superior.

For example, I would never consider an OS that doesn't let me choose my default apps, or customize my home screen (at least the home screen... colums of icons... in 2018... really?), or let me transfer files as I please to and from a computer simply using drag and drop, or have a file system/manager or.. an antivirus!

For me, it's just unbelievable that people argue and/or believe that a such limited OS can be considered superior to Android.

Anyway... I digress... LOL.

This year I think they took a step away from that in order to remind everyone that they are different from Android, which may not have been the best choice. For example, in order to try and differentiate itself from Androids, Apple released FaceID and replaced the home button in favor of a gesture system which I believe is not as efficient as a home button and is more of a gimmick than an advancement in efficiency. FaceID is an incredible concept but its been proven that as good as it is, a fingerprint sensor is still more secure and quicker and there's a lot of room for it to grow.

I dunno...ramping up to Apple-scale production levels while maintaining quality has risks of its own. Not just the risk that scaling up doesn't work but also the risk some new tech comes along tomorrow to render your massive factory obsolete unless you invest *even more*. Does Apple want to *permanently* be in the display business? Maybe, but it's a potential distraction. I think Apple would only risk it if they had reason to think their in-house product would be substantially *better* than the competition so as to make it a competitive advantage they can control. Mere ""anywhere close"" doesn't cut it.

If Samsung can *definitely* provide all the screens needed at the quality level needed because Samsung has *already eaten the sunk costs* of building those factories and scaling and staffing them up, using Samsung as a supplier makes sense *if* Apple can negotiate the cost down to a competitive level. They absolutely want to have other options in those negotiations - either by doing it themselves or by subsidizing a competitor, but any specific move in that game could easily be a bluff.",True,True,0.8368

&gt;you can get something for half the price and faster if you just stick to windows which is a far better OS

That‚Äôs debatable. I use both. There are things MacOS does better and vice versa. If I‚Äôm going to play games or do legacy applications or use Great Plains/Office I‚Äôm sticking to windows. If I want to browse/do some light web work, especially mobile, I‚Äôll take a MacBook Pro. As for the iMac, I don‚Äôt think the iMacs are a good value at all and I wouldn‚Äôt want one. A few years ago they weren‚Äôt bad back when you could get the 5K iMac for $2500, the only other 5K screen on the market was a Dell monitor - that‚Äôs it. No PC built in.

yes and no, the fact you can't take something to a third party for repairs without voiding the warranty is unethical.

Also, Apple have stopped disclosing how much they spend on ads a few years back, but before that they were spending much less than competitors. See here for example...

Yes they did marketing well, but plenty of companies do good ads and don‚Äôt have the products to back it up.

The Vivo Nex showed one way to get a better screen-to-body ratio without creating a phone that looks like something out of the Mattel catalog for 3 year olds. People moan about the risks of a mechanical design like that but compared to an eyesore like a notch it is about a billion times more agreeable. I never take selfies, the Nex is a perfect design. The Oppo X is another phone that innovates and does it right, even though here the mechanism has to operate for back-camera photos as well.

Do you have any examples of this with proof?

You can still get flagship iPhones with touchID (iPhone 8 has all the same specs as the X).

With iPhones you have the option to either slow down the phone to preserve battery life, or not, which will result in your phone suddenly cutting out when it shows battery life is still remaining (something android phones do, since you don‚Äôt have the option here like with iPhone).

With iPhones you get:

A much better security model, an OS that doesn‚Äôt track you every move for the purpose of advertisements, much better and more optimized apps because there is an approval process that keeps most of the trash out of the App store (plus devs tend to optimize for iPhone, like your Adobe example), app priority (for example iPhone had instagram two years ahead of Android), a device that works much cleaner within an ecosystem instead of using a bunch of disjointed 3rd party apps across all devices to try and achieve the same results, AirDrop, iMessage, OS updates for years (5S is still supported), family sharing with paid apps, Apple Pay is more widely accepted, much better performance - [iPhone crushes Android flagships in every area](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-8-benchmarks-fastest-phone,review-4676.html), no bloat, [68% of all infected devices, including computers, were Android.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/android-vs-ios-vs-windows-which-suffers-most-infections-nokia-reveals-all/), only 3% were iOS (rest were Windows), and you get IRL support.",True,False,0.979

Source: I worked with hardware for 9 years.

Your tiers of laptops are from entry level, which is your cheapest crappiest stuff, all the way up to crazy enterprise. The vast majority of money is being spent in the top tiers of laptops - this is where most of Apple's line, and Microsofts line resides.

All the other major players also have laptops here, but like Huawei, the bulk of their sales come from the cheap laptops that aren't expected to last more than 2-3 years.

A Surface Book Pro, or a Macbook Pro can easily last 5+ years.

As to your phone &amp; update issues, if you think that's bad then try looking at Huawei, Samsung, Google, or anybody else.

Yeah ... I just told you I worked with hardware for 9 years. I know exactly what ""line"" these companies offer. The reality is that there's almost no difference.

Look up what a Core i5 vPro is. It's literally just a system that helps companies control their laptops remotely and track them easier.

In Apple's case there literally is no difference. The same goes for Microsoft btw. They sell the exact same line of laptops to consumers and business.

You're talking about a business model that pretty much stopped over a decade ago. Putting a vPro processor in a laptop instead of a regular one doesn't mean it's a different build quality.

&gt;there is no real advantage of cheap, medium, and expensive laptops. the price sadly does not represent the value you get.

Im on the go at different client sites and at the office throughout the week, and am on the phone/conference calls about 85% of the week. I've never had any complaints about the quality on my end. The charge lasts as long as advertised. I just make sure I charge up the case every other day. The hear-through feature was something I never knew I needed until I used it. It's a great feature for the office as you can hear if anyone needs to speak with you. I also enjoy the feature that let's you hear your own voice when on a call so your not dealing with the stuffy sound of your voice and breath that you usually get with in-ear buds. 

I don't use Siri or Google Assistant much, but the few times I've used them, it's been fine. There's also no noticable lag when watching videos. 

I use an iPhone XR for work and a Galaxy S8 as my personal phone. Being able to pair them to both devices at the same time is a HUGE plus. When I'm listening to a podcast on my personal phone and I get an incoming call on my work phone, the playback will stop and pickup the call from my work phone. It has been seamless so far. 

The only thing that bugs me about the case is that it is not magnetic to the buds, which isn't a huge deal. 

I've been an airpod user as well, and I will never go back. I've always preferred in-ear buds instead of the pod style, and I just don't see the appeal of those giant white pods hanging off my ear. The Jabras fit great, have never fallen out, and have a sleek, more professional look to them.

However, recently they‚Äôve actually been selling pretty advanced technology and state of the art features. 

A couple years ago, the iPhone had a worse screen, slower processor, worse camera, etc. than an Android phone. Today, the iPhone X has the fastest processor ever seen in a phone, a really good screen second to only Samsung, great camera but that‚Äôs just below a Google Pixel 2, great battery life. Not only that, it has the most advanced facial recognition sensor in a phone due to its ability to see depth and can‚Äôt be fooled by a mask or a picture. While $1000 seems expensive, that‚Äôs the same price as a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and slightly more expensive than a Pixel 2 XL. The AirPods you mentioned can connect automatically to your iPhone without setup required, automatically pause music when one is taken out, have gestures and more. Mac products are starting to be priced fairly too. A Linus Tech Tips video I saw broke down the price of the components of an iMac Pro which costs $5000 and found that it‚Äôs actually cheaper than buying the components themselves.

The only issue I‚Äôm having now with it is the mute switch doesn‚Äôt always work. If it weren‚Äôt for that, the phone would be in perfect shape. Planned obsolescence my ass.

If you want to talk about planned obsolescence, let me tell you a story of a Samsung product I used to own. I had a Gear Fit 2. Besides having terrible battery life, it was a fine product. I got a good deal on a new one a year ago, $130 on amazon. The last few months, it became harder and harder to charge. The contacts on the watch were wearing out. It finally got to the point where it wouldn‚Äôt charge anymore. So less than a year after I bought it, I called up Samsung to see if I could get it fixed. Customer service rep was very nice, said my watch was still under warranty, that my issue was a known problem and she‚Äôd put in a support ticket to get it fixed. I sent my watch in. Got an email a few days later saying they received it and it still said ‚Äúcovered by warranty.‚Äù

Now the fun part. A few days later, I get an email saying they‚Äôre requesting payment to have my watch fixed. They now say it‚Äôs not under warranty and it‚Äôll cost $230 to fix. I got a deal at $130 but the retail price is still $180, far less than the repair quote.

1987,9ezwvc,2018-09-11 18:07:18,1536689238,"They could take a lesson from HP, awarded an A by Greenpeace for product life extension. It makes products that are easily upgraded and taken apart (including laptops and tablets with replaceable batteries) and it shares repair and disassembly instructions widely.

‚ÄúDesigning for repair makes a huge difference in the life cycle impact of the product,‚Äù says Gary Cook, a senior corporate campaigner at Greenpeace. Some tech companies, including Apple, have actively opposed so-called ‚Äúright to repair‚Äù legislation that would require companies to share information on how to take apart products.

Apple has made some public commitments on recycling. It offers a take-back program, where it pays for products to be properly recycled at facilities it vets. Apple hasn‚Äôt disclosed how much of the material it creates that it takes back, but other recyclers tell me it‚Äôs likely a fraction. An industry-funded program called Call2Recycle last year collected 2.7 million pounds of lithium-ion batteries, which it said represents a ""single digit percentage"" of all the ones sold in the U.S.

Last year, Apple said it was working toward a ‚Äúclosed-loop‚Äù supply chain for its products, in which it will someday make products out of recycled or renewable materials only. It has also been working on robots that can recycle some of its products more quickly and safely than humans. Its latest, called Daisy, can disassemble 200 iPhones in an hour. So far, there‚Äôs only one Daisy robot (with a second in the works), and Apple hasn‚Äôt said how many iPhones Daisy has recycled. Recycling companies that handle thousands of different kinds of electronics say they‚Äôre skeptical they‚Äôd reap much benefit from a robot that takes apart only one kind of thing.  Most people I spoke to in the recycling industry agree there‚Äôs a better fix: Go back to removable batteries. ‚ÄúYou can have very elegant design and high-energy density,‚Äù says Carl Smith, the CEO of Call2Recycle. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think those are two totally independent notions.‚Äù

So as a gadget reviewer, let me say this clearly to the tech industry: Give up your thin obsession. We‚Äôll happily take electronics with a little extra junk in the trunk if it means we can easily replace batteries to make them last longer ‚Äî and feel more confident they won‚Äôt end up igniting a recycling inferno.",True,False,0.9913
1988,9ezwvc,2018-09-11 18:07:18,1536689238,"MADISON, Wis. ‚Äî What happens to gadgets when you‚Äôre done with them? Too often, they explode.

As we enter new-gadget buying season, spare a moment to meet the people who end up handling your old stuff. Isauro Flores-Hernandez, who takes apart used smartphones and tablets for a living, keeps thick gloves, metal tongs and a red fireproof bin by his desk here at Cascade Asset Management, an electronics scrap processor. He uses them to whisk away devices with batteries that burst into flames when he opens them for recycling.

One corner of his desk is charred from an Apple iPhone that began smoking and then exploded after he opened it in 2016. Last year, his co-worker had to slide away an exploding iPad battery and evacuate the area while it burned out.

Around the world, garbage trucks and recycling centers are going up in flames. The root of the problem: volatile lithium-ion batteries sealed inside our favorite electronics from Apple, Samsung, Microsoft and more. They‚Äôre not only dangerous but also difficult to take apart ‚Äî making e-waste less profitable, and contributing to a growing recycling crisis.

These days, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are in smartphones, tablets, laptops, ear buds, toys, power tools, scooters, hoverboards and e-cigarettes.

For all their benefits at making our devices slim, powerful and easy to recharge, lithium-ion batteries have some big costs. They contain Cobalt, often mined in inhumane circumstances in places like the Congo. And when crushed, punctured, ripped or dropped, lithium-ion batteries can produce what the industry euphemistically calls a ‚Äúthermal event.‚Äù It happens because these batteries short circuit when the super-thin separator between their positive and negative parts gets breached. Remember Samsung‚Äôs exploding Note 7 smartphone? That was a lithium-ion thermal event.

Old devices end up in trouble when we throw them in the trash, stick them in the recycling bin, or even responsibly bring them to an e-waste center. There isn‚Äôt official data on these fires, but the anecdotal evidence is stark. Since the spring of 2018 alone, batteries have been suspected as the cause of recycling fires in New York, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin, Indiana, Idaho, Scotland, Australia and New Zealand. In California, a recent survey of waste management facilities found 83 percent had at least one fire over the last two years, of which 40 percent were caused by lithium-ion batteries.

Statistically, the fire rates are low ‚Äî 1 out of 3,000 mobile device batteries that Cascade handles experiences a thermal event. But when batteries spark other material, the result can be catastrophic. In 2016, the Shoreway Environmental Center that serves Silicon Valley suffered a 4-alarm fire it suspects was caused by a lithium-ion battery that went undetected amid other junk in its sorting systems. The fire damage cost $8.5 million.

There‚Äôs plenty of blame to go around. People shouldn‚Äôt carelessly throw battery-powered electronics into the bin. (Here‚Äôs what you should do.) Local governments haven‚Äôt figured out good ways for us to hand off of this common but dangerous material. The tech press (including me) should write less about shiny new things and more about how to make old stuff last longer. Some gadget makers, including Apple, are taking steps to make recycling easier.

But ultimately, this is an environmental problem of the tech industry‚Äôs own design. And it‚Äôs time they own it.

It‚Äôs bad enough that lithium-ion batteries are dangerous. But often, gadgets designed to be thin and portable make the batteries especially difficult to remove.

To see it like a recycler, I spent a day with Flores-Hernandez at Cascade, the e-waste company in Wisconsin. It takes in all kinds of electronics from businesses that pay it to wipe data and recycle ‚Äî some 257,000 items last year. When it can, Cascade refurbishes devices, or harvests valuable parts. When stuff is too old, Cascade pulls it apart and tries to salvage commodities.

That‚Äôs easier said than done with some of our favorite mobile devices. Out of his stack of used tablets, Flores-Hernandez shows me a 6-year-old iPad with a shattered screen. Before it could be sent to a shredder, which separates the materials that can be melted down, he has to get out the battery ‚Äî by hand.

I should have taken a seat ‚Äî the process took 40 minutes. To get to the battery, first Flores-Hernandez has to remove the electronics on top of it. Step one: He puts the iPad on a 100-degree heating plate for about four minutes to loosen glue that adheres the screen. Then off comes broken glass, the screen and dozens of tiny screws.

There‚Äôs no indication Apple products are more likely to catch fire than other devices (though Cascade says they‚Äôve been the source of all their fires since 2015). But iPads are more difficult to take apart. ‚ÄúOn a scale of 1 to 10, I would say this is an 8 or 9,‚Äù says Flores-Hernandez.

He learned how to do this through a training program from iFixit, an online repair community. Apple and many other manufacturers don‚Äôt provide instructions or analysis software to recyclers like Cascade. Handling this stuff is tricky even for its makers: Apple stores in Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands have all experienced battery fires in 2018.

About 30 minutes into iPad surgery comes the most delicate part: prying out the battery glued to the back of the iPad. After heating the iPad again to loosen glue, he uses a series of plastic squeegees to nudge the battery ‚Äî as flat as a plastic comb and almost as wide as the iPad ‚Äî out bit by bit.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bend it. Don‚Äôt poke it. Just try to go slow,‚Äù says Flores-Hernandez. I hold my breath. Our iPad doesn‚Äôt explode. This time.

Smaller gadgets with lithium-ion batteries like vape pens and headphones are more difficult to detect in a pile of waste, and can be even harder to disassemble. Apple‚Äôs wireless AirPods, for one, have been dubbed all but impossible to recycle by iFixit because they contain three batteries, each sealed inside plastic.

It‚Äôs more than just a safety issue, says Cascade‚Äôs CEO Neil Peters-Michaud. Gluing components together and hiding the batteries also makes recycling less profitable. For the training, safety precautions and effort that went into removing that iPad battery, Cascade will make about 50 cents to $1 in commodities. ‚ÄúLabor and time are money,‚Äù Peters-Michaud says.

‚ÄúI just don't understand why Apple doesn't include design features that its users and the reuse-and-recycling community can benefit from to extend the life of their products safely,‚Äù he says.

The risk is that devices like old iPads could become unrecyclable, at least in economic terms, for scrap companies that aren‚Äôt getting paid some other way. Today, firms can still make money by reselling iPads. But who‚Äôs going to process all the old iPads currently marooned in drawers, losing their market value?

‚ÄúWe are reaching the pivot point that it is a more costly process to separate the materials than the value of the materials that can be recovered,‚Äù says Craig Boswell, the co-founder HOBI International, an e-waste company with locations in Arizona, Illinois and Texas. ‚ÄúThat applies not only to the iPad, but most of the designs that have internally sealed batteries.‚Äù

Gadgets don‚Äôt have to be designed this way. In 2014, Samsung‚Äôs flagship Galaxy S5 smartphone had a rechargeable battery that could be easily removed. My old PalmPilot used two AAA alkaline batteries that just pop out. Removable batteries could have helped Apple avoid the debacle in which it got caught slowing iPhones with worn-out batteries ‚Äî and then had to offer discounted battery replacements to get back in our good graces.

The sealed approach makes electronics thinner, which the companies say we want ‚Äî removable batteries require additional shielding that takes up space. Sealing in a battery with a life span of just a few years is also a way to force customers to upgrade, though tech giants have said they‚Äôre not baking planned obsolescence into their designs.

Apple wouldn‚Äôt answer my questions on its practices.

Apple, which does more for concerns like clean energy and hazardous chemicals than most big tech firms, is hardly alone in designing products with recycling challenges.

Last year, Greenpeace graded companies for their overall environmental impact. That included a grade for ‚Äúproduct life extension,‚Äù a measure of how products are designed to be taken apart for repair, reuse and recycling. Most firms, including Apple, Microsoft and Samsung, got D‚Äôs in that category.

Anyway, my point, way back at the start of this conversation, was that Apple not making a small phone doesn't mean the small phone is going to die, and I used Apple discarding of the headphone jack as an example: Apple deciding they didn't want to support wired headphones didn't lead to the death of wired headphones. If your head is hurting, go have a quick lie down and come back.

You then argued the point by saying that wired headphones are becoming less popular. You did this without evidence, and without acknowledging the myriad of flaws that argument has even assuming your premise were true.

Meanwhile, other companies can make a more feature filled smartphone with better all around specs for $350. Obviously I'm going to buy the $20 pencil.

Did Apple spend a lot of money making the iPhone XR? Yeah. Do I give a single shit when I can get better or the same for so much less? Absolutely not. Do I care that Apple needs to cover their costs? Nope. Therefore, the optimal mid-range phone is going to be the $350 phone. 

This automatically makes $350 the optimal price for a mid-range phone. Which means selling your ""budget"" phone that does literally nothing special for $750 is overpricing your smartphone. It's a really straightforward issue, there's not much to discuss here. But the main issue here is that it's Apple.

Let's get this straight, Apple is a company obsessed with maintaining an image. The reason the XR is overpriced isn't because of some secret cost in manufacturing and design, it's literally got the same design, manufacturing process and software as the X which came last year.

I actually agree with this. That is why I am a big fan of these chinese knockoff phones, they are giving you exactly the same product more or less. The biggest difference though is more on the software feature side. Android based phones have multi-window tasking. Meaning I can open as many apps and windows of browsers as I want at the same time. I can watch youtube, text, play a game int he background, and be in a video call with a friend all at the same time, and if I were to switch I would lose all of those hugely convenient features.

But so does google and samsung? They both archive your contacts list with your email address, so that you never lose them. I have all my contacts and have never lost them once over 8+ generations of phones.

I just disagree that they have the best platform at all. They are grossly behind in user convenience features, they are behind in terms of performance, and they are the most expensive phones on the market.

2238,9gtsqb,2018-09-18 10:59:13,1537268353,"Yeah, check around a bit. Plans and pricing are available on the websites of almost all of the big guys. A few years back all the major carriers started moving away from subsidized phones, where your bill remained the same no matter how old your phone was. Now they all offer financing plans where the entire cost of the phone is spread over 2 years and after that two years, your bill drops down to only the price of the service. It's actually a pretty great deal for people that like to keep their phone longer than 2 years.

For example, single-line unlimited packages from Verizon and AT&amp;T are somewhere around $75. If you get the top of the line iPhone the price works out to around $45/month over 2 years. So for 2 years, your bill would be $120 (plus taxes and fees). After those 2 years, you'd have paid off the phone, so your bill would drop down to just the $75/month for the service.

Or, if you've got a phone you like, and you already own it outright, you can switch and just pay the price of the plan from the start.

That having been said, each carrier has different tiers of ""unlimited"" that offer varying speeds and throttling limits, so I'm not sure if it's an exact apples to apples comparison to your current plan, but it's probably worth looking into.

Sorry if that sounds like a sales pitch. I don't work for any carriers, I've just seen a lot of people burned by holding onto an old plan.

I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre not getting it. Apple is willing to give you $600 for the phone, after a year, if you want to have them pay the loan off for you and start a new loan. It is not something you have to do if you are on iUP, it is just 1 of many options at your disposal. Your welcome to sell it yourself if you want, or keep it. Either way, you‚Äôre responsible for the full cost of the phone. No different than if you just paid cash for it all upfront. 

&gt;Not being in the iUP and selling it on your own every year is still a better option though.

In what way? The only difference is, your way strips you of having an additional option.

Android tablets are said to be dead because there are very few high-quality tablet-optimized apps on the Play Store. If you want to do something productive on a tablet, simply avoid Android ones and either go with an iPad, which has a lot of better apps though iOS can be annoying (to say the least) at times for some. Despite the latter fact, the iPad Pro is the best pure tablet you can get right now period. However, for ""light indoor use"" it is probably an overkill.

On the other spectrum, Windows 2-in-1 laptops/tablets allow you to have the full productivity of Windows but when it comes to being a tablet it's not as a pleasant experience as iPad or even Android, due to, again, very few high-quality tablet-optimized apps *and* many parts of the system are designed for mouse and keyboard, e.g. explorer is still not nice to use with touch. But, if you need a laptop more than you need a tablet it can fulfill both your needs with one device. Another point is that Windows devices use Intel processors which will drain the battery more quickly than than their ARM counterparts.

For light use of watching videos or reading books or comics a mid-range Android tablet will do fine, as long as it has the pretty screen you have. You can do some occasional document writing on it but i wouldn't go much further than that (if someone disagrees do correct me).",True,False,0.3931

Choose the iPhone if you want. What I‚Äôm saying is you can‚Äôt have a better experience for a cheaper price. Many people buy Apple because they feel it is too difficult to learn how to use android and you‚Äôll get viruses. But MIUI makes this so much better, a simple easy experience. You can get an antivirus and be fine! 

I get many people have brand loyalty, but you shouldn‚Äôt have brand loyalty when you are being quite simple, greatly overcharged! I used to buy iPhones, but then I researched and realised how much more expensive Apple was than other android phones and opted for the latter.

So don't get me wrong, until the s8 line I was an iPhone fanboy.  Not apple as a whole, but I thought iPhone was the best phone.

The note 8 has higher pixel density than ipbone and everything is just super sharp.  The infinity display feels and looks great, and it doesn't have the notch so full screen stuff looks immaculate.  It has 6 gigs of ram and the snapdragon 835 so the thing can multitask like crazy and apps run like a dream.  Because of this, the system is as snappy as the iphone now.  I always hated how laggy android phones felt but that's not the case with the note 8.

It has the S pen which i use regularly especially for doing things like signing documents which I've already had to do several times so that's awesome.

Has a headphone jack so you can use aux cables still, and nice headphones.

Note 8 has ip68 rating which makes it water proof and dust proof.  

Biometric options are great like the iris scanner which uses infrared which is dope.  Finger scanner is also great and a lot of people complain about the position but I hypothesize they're just apple sympathizers. Lol.  

The camera is also incredible, and while the iphone may have a ""better one"" I'd argue that's really only important if you're actively doing Instagram stuff or whatever.  Either way the camera is leagues nicer than previous android cams.

Oh, don't forget that the note 8 also has expandable memory.  Oh, and you can manage your phone's internal files from the phone, or the computer which is a million times easier than iTunes bullshit.

Last observation that I'll make (but not that there is) is that I can fully customize the UI and feel of my phone with themes and launchers.  I use smart launcher which is probably the nicest UI for a phone I've ever used and I have a nice dark theme so all of my system is nice and dark.  So for me that's a huge win.  Idk, I just like customizing my phone to me, instead of the other way around.  

There's so much you can do on this phone, but overall the biggest thing for me is that while android has always technically been superior, the note 8 is the first Android I've used that has feel as premium as the iPhone, and had the power to really do what I want and make the whole experience feel great.  This is coming from an ex-iphone fanboy.  Go hit up your local phone stores and just try it out.  Its great.

There used to be a superb accurate battery health app that checked your battery wear and was able to tell you your battery health, current capacity and voltage, charger information, and time remaining for talk, 3G, 4G, etc.  
  
Around iOS 11, Apple contacted them and forced them to remove ALL battery testing from the app if they wanted to stay on the apple store, and to try to trick previous purchasers of the app to update it (and secretly lose those abilities).

Thank you for the recommendation; I will look into it.  
  
But its existence does not disprove that Apple is up to something.  
  
1) the system may not have caught up with them yet, and  
  
2) they might not be reading the actual battery info, they might be just reporting data that Apple claims is true which they have incorporated into the OS.  
  
If Apple is not misrepresenting their battery info then they have no reason to pull an app that does report accurately from the market.  
  
Unfortunately neither of us has access to Apple's reasoning (they often don't provide it to their app writers, either; the agreement says they don't have to provide you a reason, nor do they have to ""have"" one).  
  
For all we know, Apple could be taking a page from Microsoft and sabotaging anyone who doesn't pay top tithe, and other app/s beat them out.  ""Business"" does work that way in some cases; and to deny it is putting your head in the sand.

That isn‚Äôt replacing the motherboard... it‚Äôs that easy to remove an SSD from one motherboard and put it into another motherboard. This is true on any MacBook Pro starting with the introduction of ‚Äúretina‚Äù and ending with the touchbar models, so roughly 2012-2017. 

 For comparison, on my 2010 MacBook it takes 4 screws and about 3 minutes. This is true for any pre-2012 model or MacBook or MacBook Pro. 

That‚Äôs how most M.2 drives on the market work, and apple was just using a standard m.2 drive with a proprietary connector to force you to pay them an extra premium for an inferior product.

It‚Äôs incredibly common. There are certain apple stores that you have to avoid because they‚Äôre terrible. The problem is, if a 3rd party is shit, I can drive 5 minutes away to a better one. If an Apple store is shit, I have to drive 4+ hours to another one.

Also don‚Äôt forget that for a lot of people, there isn‚Äôt an Apple store anywhere close by. I have a computer repair store that I trust more than Apple 5 minutes from my house. (I‚Äôve traded computer parts with them, gotten them to do repairs on multiple iDevices, and their repairs are so good that Apple stores can‚Äôt tell the difference.) However, the closest Apple store is 2 1/2 hours away. Some people live in countries where they literally don‚Äôt even have an apple store.

What you're doing is ""something that's technologically/physically possible"" .. what the Apple Techs are saying is:.. ""Our policy doesn't allow us to do that"". So .. there's a difference there. (I'm not arguing their explanation is justified .. but for clarity, they aren't saying ""It's not technically possible"". They're saying ""We don't do that."" 

&gt; ""Also, it‚Äôs not 5-7 years. It‚Äôs 5 years maximum unless you live in California or turkey, where they are legally required to support it longer.""

No. That's not technically correct. There's no wording on the ""Vintage and Obsolete"" web-page that uses the word ""Maximum"". Apple could absolutely choose to support a particular product for longer than 5 years. They typically don't.. but they are free to do so anytime they choose to. 

&gt; ""It‚Äôs incredibly common.""

More hyperbole. If it's ""incredibly common""... why aren't Apple Store after Apple Store after Apple Store going out of business ?... Why no nationwide lawsuits from the BBB ?... If it's so incredibly common... we should be seeing headlines after headlines after headlines about horrible service at Apple Stores everywhere. But we don't.

I never said it doesnt happen,   I said it‚Äôs not ‚Äúincredibly commonplace‚Äù as you seem to want to infer/imply.

But given decades of success (in nearly every area of their business) including repeat awards for Customer Satisfaction and Reliability and becoming the first Trillion dollar company,.. its obvious to just about any casual passerby that they‚Äôre doing most things right. 

Apple isnt gonna reverse-course and magically turn into the company you (individually) want them to be. So... complain if you want,.. but you‚Äôre 100% wasting your time (and all the while doing so, look like a fool peeing into a headwind).

And people wonder why 3rd party technicians exist. Faced between having an incompetent technician delete your data, and someone else swapping out a part on your computer but keeping your data, why wouldn‚Äôt you?

The best trackpad, the best screen, and the worst keyboard, annoying and expensive touchbar, and worst processor cooling.

 The software is part of what I absolutely can't stand, lack of real customization, feels very closed off from non-apple devices, the tendency to not support devices long term very well (although many companies are like this). The notification tray and ""settings from any screen"" system seems like it's a decade behind development compared to Android. As well the navigation up to the X (which I haven't used a bit) always felt incredibly clunky compared to Android, especially later in Android's life.

As well, I just don't like a lot of apples business decisions, I respect and understand them but don't like them. Only allowing MacOS to integrate with the iOS platform (mostly imessage is the issue). Not putting out an ""imessage"" app for Android (although it would kill a lot of user base). Closing off repair from third party businesses and bricking devices if it detects 3rd party tinkering. That whole battery/CPU throttling issue last year was awful.

2726,9od3ps,2018-10-15 14:22:19,1539613339,"The _Palm Pilot_ was a PDA. It was never made as a smartphone; though if you had one of the few models which featured a Springboard slot I believe you could add a Handspring‚Ñ¢ cellular modem card for web access (but not voice calling or SMS messaging).   
  
The _Palm Treo_ was the first widely available smartphone, which had a full QWERTY hardware keyboard, 320x320 color touchscreen with stylus, 640x480 resolution camera, CDMA &amp; GSM connections (US models), Bluetooth, an infrared port, &amp; a squarish USB\charging connector that wouldn't break the way mini-USB &amp; micro-USB connectors do.   
  
The _Palm Treo_ ran the _Palm_ OS (""Garnet"" version, I believe), _not_ that abortive bastard WebOS. It had a _lot_ more capabilities than the Blackberry messaging phones sold at the time, &amp; in fact had more robust hardware features &amp; more advanced software available than the iPhone did when it released years later.   
  
The _Palm OS_ even allowed apps to have direct hardware access, which is a major security weakness for the casual users who dominate the smartphone market today, but for the dedicated technicians who established the smartphone market, it was an indispensable _tool_; not a toy, or a ""dumb-terminal"", the way most smartphones get used today. Direct hardware access allowed Palm OS apps to do a few things that even the most extravagant Android apps can't do today even with Root level permissions.   
  
When the iPhone took nearly 3/5 of the market (iOS has _never_ been the most prevalent mobile OS, by the way folks), _Palm_ responded with the slimmed down _Palm Centro_ which still ran _Palm OS_, &amp; was cheaper &amp; smaller than the _Treo_ but never sold very well.   
  
Eventually _Palm_ gave up on their legacy OS because the market was being flooded by non tech-savvy users who couldn't be trusted with apps as capable (&amp; hence vulnerable) as a full PC's. _Palm_ created WebOS, then quickly abandoned it when they failed to regain lost market share, &amp; soon _Palm_ was effectively dead.   
  
In terms of raw flexibility there has never been another smartphone as powerful as the _Treo_ &amp; most handsets still lack some of its most powerful features. (For instance, why _wouldn't_ you want an infrared port? Most devices still use infrared remotes, &amp; having all devices controllable from one app with custom button labels &amp; layouts is like a god-send, for me.) The apps &amp; accessories available for _Palm OS_ were _amazing._ It took almost ten years for Android devices to mature enough to be truly comparable, &amp; iOS devices _still_ aren't, due to missing hardware features. It had an audio stack with realtime EQ, even though Android didn't get EQ capability until the 4G era. It played common video filetypes that I had to wait around for years to see supported on other mobile devices. It had an SD slot for expandable storage that I still can't live without. A lot of PC apps were ported to run quite effectively on it: My Palm Treo 650p ran Doom &amp; Quake more smoothly than the PC I had at the time.   
  
The _Palm Pilot_ was never a smartphone, but the _Palm Treo_ was _THE BEST_ smartphone of its time, &amp; aside from incremental upgrades in memory, storage, &amp; processing speeds (which only barely keep up with software bloat), I would _still_ be hard pressed to think of a more capable smartphone. In many ways, I think it's the best smartphone _ever._",True,False,0.9807

The ugly notch, the lack of 3.5mm headphone jack the fact that Google jumped on the bandwagon that Apple created.

Other OEMs can make phones with smaller notches or no notch and look better than the iPhones, which suffer the same fate as the pixel this year.

I dont know what boardroom meetings went on with notches aside from bleh apples doing it so  lets do one also incase the design trend catches on.

Assuming the data sampled during the Beta phases were not sufficient to predict how much the update could cripple some devices and in some case render them unusable. What if at that point, the throttling that was intended to temporarily slow down the processor to avoid battery spikes and then revert the speed back to normal gradually to avoid unexpected shutdown. It would make sens to me because back in iOS 10, the OS was not self testing it‚Äôs battery efficiency the way it was later introduced in 11.3 with the battery Health. 
It is also possible that the throttling was built in at the core of iOS 11 and because of that a big part of the OS itself had to be reworked to enable customers to turn it off (assuming). That could mean that the data of how old battery could be affected by iOS 11 performance management could only be harvested through the battery fiasco and explains why Apple, in an attempt to damage control shifted the development course to build iOS 12 for performance on older device and came up with the battery replacement program as a temporary solution for customer while they looked into the problem at it‚Äôs core and built the option to turn off the throttling then later releasing iOS 12.  
I like to explore this idea that the battery fiasco was neither intentional nor were the aftermaths predicted by Apple. It is very possible that for the engineering team iOS 11 release has been a year of disasters that they managed their best to fix and because they couldn‚Äôt come out with the right solution fast enough things turned out they way they did.

From a marketing perspective, Its actually genious if you think about it. The level of skewed statistics and one sided aruments you fan boys conjure up is super impressive. You think im covinced with your examples? You havent shown me any evidence that is actually concrete with exception to the phone comparison. Yes the iphone is fast. Well, to be exact, the operating system is fast. Iphones are good phones and a step above the competition, no doubt. But holy shit do you nitpick your statistics. The arm based? system on a chip architecture is nothing close compared to x86. Just because a phone is faster means nothing in a PC environment.  I dont have any idea what the macbook example is you mentioned that i should know but i know for a fact it will get destroyed with an equivalently priced alternative. Here's the thing, computers are made of components: ram, mobo, proc etc. Macbooks are just a hardware platform. Equivently speced hardware from different manufacterers rarely performs much differently. Im sure a 1200 high spec hackintosh will match the latest and greatest from apple. I dont knlw shit about what apple sells in pc form but i know i could build a comp with high end hardware that would destroy any prebuilt computer apple has for probably less than a 1/3 of the price. I'd bet money it would be more reliable too. 

Enough with the touch sensors biometrics and builf shit already. Who cares? Im sure you can get thse anywhere. The touch bar system sucks. Ecosystem? You mean an extremely dumbed down bsd clone? Thanks but no thanks. I hate MacOS.  Also, enough with the xps shit. I dont own one, end of story. BTW, you're the fanboy, not me. So find a different description, because this is what i used to describe you. Lastly, Buying an overpriced laptop and theoretically selling it for a high price is good, but not so much when the difference you lose is enough to buy a better alternative in itself.

Geekbench has the A11 clocking in at just north of 10k, and the 845 at just under 8.5k for multicore

&gt; single core that is around 1/2 the pyhsical size to the other. They are fundementally designed differently, apple uses a custom design for their CPUs where they went for a bigger die with lower clock speeds, whereas qualcomm uses the generic arm ones which have smaller dies and higher clockspeeds that means qualcomm can fit more cores into the same space.

They're both ARM-based chips. By your logic, we can't compare AMD and Intel CPUs because they're designed differently.

&gt; Look you would have avoided looking stupid here if you took a minute from your time to check that Adobe RGB covers 30% more than sRGB. At this point you're not stupid, you have some form of severe autism. Do your research first atleast before making up shit on the spot and praying it's right.

I looked at the info for the wrong variant of DCIP3. There's 3 of them. And I remain correct. Adobe RGB covers more cyan than P3 does, but P3 covers more reds and yellows.

&gt; HFS+ is the worst modern filesystem ever, it's so stupidly designed. NTFS isn't great but it's a lot better than the pile of shit that is HFS+. You obviously don't know what you're saying because it's basically agreed upon that HFS+ is the worst modern filesystem available right now, I mean it has the ability to corrupt it's own user's data WOW! Sad thing is case insensitivty is whre ntfs stops being bad. HFS+ however uses NFD normalization

Aside from the 255 character limit, case insensitivity, and its magical ability to fragment itself constantly, it's better alright /s. Besides, HFS+ is no longer. APFS is the new one. And from what I've seen, it seems to wipe the floor with NTFS.

&gt; Are you one of those people who think the tech world would be lost without apple? You sure sound like one. Buy all there products for all I care, but don't act like you bought them because of their superior performance.

No. They just make good products, and their focus on polish and privacy is much appreciated. And I'm not sure why that's the bone you chose to pick. Their A-series chips are crazy powerful, the watch is far and away the most popular smartwatch, and the iPad is basically the only game in town for tablets. It's continually ranked as the best tablet out there by just about every reviewer (mostly due to Android OEMs pushing out stuff for low end, which obviously isn't as good as a more expensive device).

&gt; ‚ÄãAnd tell me more about Samsung having every device failing from the top of your head please? LG has the bootloop issues but saying they are shit is universally agreed upon, atleast their new phones and other products don't fail (laptops).

Yeah benchmarks are weighted, processors perform different functions at different speeds. Some things aren't even taken into consideration.  Look at what people like Linus torvalds say about benchmarks like geekbench in general and how they are a bad way of testing performance. And yes comparing intel and AMD CPUs with just benchmarks won't tell us much. They should not be taken as the absolute performance metric, they can only give us an idea of performance because OSes all handle background proccesses differently and CPUs are different themselves. Then again I'll say this for the 100th time a SOC is made from more than a CPU, it includes DSPs, Modems etc.

&gt; I looked at the info for the wrong variant of DCIP3. There's 3 of them.  And I remain correct. Adobe RGB covers more cyan than P3 does, but P3  covers more reds and yellows.

it covers more reds and yellows but what does that have to do with anything, RGB covers 30% while DCIP3 covers 25% more than srgb it's basic math because it covers more colors in total. They both look nice tho, but if we judge it like you did RGB would be better. 

&gt; No. They just make good products, and their focus on polish and privacy  is much appreciated. And I'm not sure why that's the bone you chose to  pick.

It's continually ranked as the best tablet out there  by just about every reviewer (mostly due to Android OEMs pushing out  stuff for low end, which obviously isn't as good as a more expensive  device). 

Let's get one thing straight microsoft, google and apple don't give a fuck about you or your privacy.  look here [https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.en.html](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.en.html), Apple is just as bad, but locked in and more expensive. They are successful because of marketing that has little to do with innovation or having the best products on the market, there are also many marketing experts who outright state that apple is only successful because of their brand. that's what makes them the most popular. You are right though that most manufacturers pulled out of the high-end tablet market.

&gt; The Note 7 debacle, the perennial ""Camera failed"" that's been plaguing  the galaxy phones for a while, and the random reboots (which are due to a  failing battery, but better reboot randomly than throttle, right?). 

you trying to say the ""camera failed"" bug is the same thing as having a device that completely fails. It's a software bug, atleast it's not physically broken and can be fixed by installing a custom rom. This is an issue that will not cost you money to fix as samsung can push an update, a iPhone with circuit failure is a different story. I rather have my phone reboot than throttle quietly in the background, because then I know there is something wrong with it and the battery needs to be replaced. It's good to throttle, but it would be even better to tell you're users that their device is throttling and needs a battery replacement instead of making them think it's slow and pushing them to upgrade.

&gt; I was gonna go with Windows 10 becoming similar to cable TV in that  despite paying for it, they still manage to cram ads into it. Or the  fact that the UI is a total mess of various design languages that were  never fully implemented, or Edge continually trying to become your  default browser, or the wonder that is the October 2018 update to it  that's randomly deleting user files for no reason. 

Lemme get this out before I continue, I'm a Linux fan just looking at my post history will show you that, I'm defending microsoft because I truly believe that Apple are no better. Apple also sells ads and spies on their users, atleast microsoft doesn't force you onto their platform like Apple when you buy their products. The UI is a mess because they decided to vendor lock in, and now have to support legacy applications. Guess who constantly tries to do the same thing and basically locks everything to the point where you don't even own the product? Ofcourse it's apple . The october 2018 update is one update, atleast it wasn't the whole filesystem that was actively curropting your data. See and read the link above for all the shit apple does and come back and tell me that they care about you.

&gt; But if you want to talk about viruses, we can do that too. I'll concede  that Mac viruses do exist, but Windows is a shitshow in that regard. 

It's not that windows is insecure by design my friend, it's the fact that they have to support so much things and push those updates quickly that makes windows buggy. UAC is a bad idea, but in this regard everything would be a ""shit show"" by your standards. Apple use to have security through obscurity they don't anymore and there are plenty of bugs that get exploited and it's actually pretty comparable to windows when you start allowing stuff to get downloaded from other sources.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is bugs happen in every OS it's in human nature, but there is always someone who thinks apple is perfect and pro-consumer and that drive me nuts.

Much like how macs cost substantially more than PC's despite having exactly the same hardware.  Companies price products based on what people will pay, and often a higher price is beneficial to make your product seem more prestigious.  

With that said, iirc the XS also has more/better cameras than the XR too.  And the XR display is a very cheap display - not just because LCD vs OLED, but the XR display isn't even 1080p (pretty shitty by modern phone standards - my older S8 is 2690x1440, vs 1792x828 on the larger XR display).  The XS is stainless steel, the XR aluminum. 

In this case, it's a pretty good marketing move by Apple.  Budget conscious buyers have a visibly comparable XR at a very good price.  Apple probably has lower margins on these, makes less money off each but sells lots more as they've traditionally ignored the budget market.  Gets more people into their ecosystem, and retains those who may defect because of cost.  And on the other hand, people who want The Good One can buy an XS, which is an objectively superior device, and feel prestigious given the cost.  It's slimmer, lighter, has more and better cameras, a better display, more ram (allowing better performance, at least in theory).

The only true way to really make the communication of the mic and some malicious software impossible is to litterally remove the microphone on the hardware level. But this chip doesn't do that. 

I think you're fundamentally flawed in your analysis here. But it's understandable because The Verge's headline is terrible and isn't actually what the security doc states. The security PDF doesn't say anything about the T2 chip being responsible for the disconnect and rather explicitly points out that even the T2 chip doesn't have the ability to circumvent the microphone disconnect. It is a *hardware disconnect* not one implemented through the chip or via software. I recommend your read the [security paper](https://www.apple.com/mac/docs/Apple_T2_Security_Chip_Overview.pdf) yourself if you want to know more.

is closed. This disconnect is implemented in hardware alone, and therefore prevents any software, even with root or kernel privileges in macOS, and even the software on the T2 chip, from engaging the microphone when the lid is closed.

I think Apple is just using the reference to the T2 chip to identify when/on what models they implemented the physical disconnect. E.g.

I think they provide great value to older people with means. All of my relatives I got to adopt, since I was providing the service, and backup regimes are much easier for them to stick to on macOS. Value is in the eye of the beholder. People with money care about saving time more than anything, and Apple definitely saves a lot of people time.

However, Apple no longer saves actual pros time. My wife (a pro) loves macOS, but the Hackintosh I built had insurmountable issues for her workflow in terms of updating, and even if we spent $12,000 on a machine, we still wouldn't get the performance $2,000 on Windows got. So she switched. 

Apple cost themselves $3,000 in profit by not offering a machine that did the work needed for an illustrator and animator. All they needed to do was make a machine with current specs, and they print money, but that's not their goal. Thankfully, the competition had a brilliant array of products we could buy, and we saved a bunch of money. There was a time cost in her relearning the windows workflow, but it's not that bad. Only the forced updates borking things is bad after her Pro version became Home after I migrated her setup from my own windows rig.

3067,9tc85n,2018-11-01 18:45:47,1541097947,"iPhone XS is IP68. iPhones have been ip67 for 3 years now (since iPhone 7).  All of the $1000 line of phones is in that group. And before iPhone 7, most rating sites noted that iPhone 5s to 6s was not ip rated but would last in water fairly well. So that‚Äôs just a wrong statement. IP68 is the highest rating any phone or case has that I‚Äôve seen. Is there a android phone with better?

The drop tests on the new XS show that its glass screens are pretty damn durable, so again not ‚Äúbuilt to break‚Äù (which I‚Äôm sure Samsung and Pixel does as well - but this is to say nothing is more ‚Äúbuilt to break‚Äù because, again, they‚Äôre equal here).

And again, the majority of parts inside are highly the same parts as in Samsung or pixel. Modems from intel or Qualcomm. Other parts from Samsung. So if ‚ÄúSamsung lets you order the parts‚Äù then you could order that same part for your iPhone. Screen repair? I can get one from the kiosk at the mall for any phone, android or iPhone. Unless you need a new fingerprint sensor. But of course 3rd party fingerprint sensors would be plenty damn stupid to allow on the market. Those are the security devices that control my iTunes and Apple Pay! I don‚Äôt want just anyone touching that, and neither does Apple. 

Apple isn‚Äôt dying. It just had its most profitable quarter ever. They sold almost as many devices for over $200 more per device. That‚Äôs a sign of market control, not loss. The A12 processor is unique in the industry (some say a whole generation ahead of Qualcomm processors in android). So yeah, Apple isn‚Äôt going anywhere and the data back it up. Samsung just turned a small loss in their mobile phone division. Google‚Äôs profits aren‚Äôt from android nor pixel. So I think the major players are all here to stay. 

Bonus content not related to your reply:
Android phones are far more likely to disallow updates than iPhones. iPhone 5S (6 years old) still gets and runs the latest iOS. Android phones typically stop getting updates after 2 years (exception being some nexus, which still don‚Äôt last 6 years).

It is an ""evolution"" of PIP (picture-in-picture), which has been around since the early 2000's (I had a Samsung ""LCD-TV""-monitor hybrid back in 2006). A brief description of these would be:

* PIP: displays multiple ([usually two](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/65p6RSv2ERk/maxresdefault.jpg)) sources at once on the screen, placing **one on top of  the other**, usually on a corner. The downsides of this is you will always have a covered area of the main source, and the secondary one is way too small for anything but video content
* PBP: you get multiple (usually [2](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vN8TYfZA2iY/maxresdefault.jpg) or [4](https://www.lg.com/us/business/product/images/UB67-B/lg-commercial-ub67-zoom02.jpg) on 21:9 screens, [2](https://www.kitguru.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2-way-PBP.jpg), [3](https://www.kitguru.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3-way-PBP.jpg) or [4](https://www.kitguru.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4-way-PBP.jpg) on 16:9) sources side-by-side, spliting the screen in 2 equal parts no matter the resolution of the sources. Disadvantages include some monitors not allowing stretching resolutions to screen (even when only stretching on one side to keep aspect ratio, only allowing 1:1 pixel-by-pixel display of the sources) and either show black bars all around or on either top+bottom or left+right. Also, you usually lose the ability to use the demanding features of the monitor, like maximum frequencies capped to 60/30Hz or even HDR. You can usually combine any source with another expcept itself (obviously right? Curiously manuals still like to include a ""pbp compatibility table"" with a ""line of Xs"" diaginally and every other cell checked. I find it mega-patronizing...)

 A lot of modern (2013-onwards) ultra-wide screens will ship with this, namely LG was kind of a pioneer on this through software and then directly on the monitor (some even ship with this without really advertising it, like my bought-last-week BenQ EX3501R, a nice surprise as I didn't think I would get that for a monitor with already so many features for it's spec and price).

One of the things that make the iOS and iPad experience is the fact that the apps the user can install are curated so meet a certain interface standard and have been optimised to work with the OS and hardware. If you deviate too far from this then you risk losing the experience and possibly performance.

Where your fully fledged OS comes into its own is the ability to run pretty much anything you can think of and in a way that meets your own needs rather than simply having to fit within a defined specification. There are Windows, Linux and MacOS applications designed to get a job done but they aren't always well written, efficient or graceful; this would create a real mismatch of hardware and software on the iPad.

There's also a lot of stuff that users want to get done that doesn't always work that well with touch which would mean changing the iPad experience.

I'm sure Apple could release a fully fledged MacOS device in the same form factor as the iPad complete with add on keyboard, trackpad and pen but they have defined product lines and a device such as this would start to merge sales of the MacBook and iPad lines.

I'm not an Apple user because the iPad doesn't meet my needs, I struggle to justify the cost of a MacBook as I can do everything I need to on a much cheaper Windows or Linux device and there are still some legacy Windows applications that I use which means somewhere in my workflow I need access to a Windows machine.",True,False,0.907

These people laughing that the MacBook Pro was only offered with USB-C ports are the same people that are simultaneously asking for everything to be USB-C. Ironically they seem unable to realise that Apple are pushing for that as an end goal as they originally did with USB in 1993 with the G3.


You people need to stop perpetuating this myth that Apple claim responsibility for inventing things.

What Apple do better than most is perfect existing technologies.

Take biometrics for example. We've had fingerprint scanners on laptops for nearly 2 decades - they've all been shite.

Then in 2011 came the Motorola Atrix with an optical fingerprint sensor - do we associate this Motorola with revolutionising how we unlock our smartphones? 

No - because Apple came in a year later with the 5S and it's capacative fingerprint scanner which turned out to be the best biometric system a consumer device had ever seen at the time.

Fingerprint scanners went on to become the norm for unlocking smartphones for the next ~6 years.

Apple didn't invent the laptop trackpad either, but they've still had the best trackpad in the industry for the past decade.

iPhone is responsible for the growth of the smartphone market, remember touchscreens before multi-touch? Do you wish we still had resistive touchscreens in our phones?

iPod revolutionised MP3 players

Magsafe revolutionised laptop chargers

AirPods revolutionised wireless earbuds

Thunderbolt revolutionised practical data transfer

I answered your question directly.  There were many retailers including Amazon that had induction chargers out from several different makers. 

The reason you see more iphone cases at Target than anything else, is because Apple has the largest single company share of the smartphone market in the **US** (40%), but globally about 12%.  Other than Samsung, it would be foolish for Target to stock for the many different brands.  Search ""smartphone wireless charger"" on Amazon and see what you get.  I would say Samsung popularized wireless charging and large format phones that Apple fought against for so long.  I remember Apple saying ""people don't want large phones"".  Any phone with induction coils can use an induction charger.  It doesn't have to be made by Samsung or Apple.

Of course Apple globally popularized the smartphone, and the first iPad tablet 2010. But the tablet goes way back over 30+ yrs, but yes, Apple made it popular worldwide, and still holds about 28% market share of tablets.  The first tablet I remember was the GridTab in 1989. The guy who developed that, went on to develop the Palm Pilot.  They were expensive, and the average Joe homeowner didn't need one or justify the cost.  But a lot of businesses used them.

So there it is. 
I‚Äôm making over my living room in the near future (probably spring). 
Right now, we have 2 ‚Äútv‚Äù. One I use for my ps4/switch
One my girlfriend use for watching show on Netflix while I game. 
I don‚Äôt find it very visually pleasing, I think it‚Äôs very practical. I love the fact that we are in the same room while I game and she‚Äôs watching tv. We have a room where the computers and my other console are (nes, snes, GameCube, PS3, wii,) but I don‚Äôt like gaming there since I‚Äôm alone and I‚Äôd rather be in the same room as we can‚Äôt talk while doing each our thing. 

So, for my new living room, I‚Äôd like to have a main tv but I‚Äôd like a way to integrate another screen, for gaming or watching shows. (And the wall where my tv would be wouldn‚Äôt be big enough to house 2 tv  and it would cost 2 tv too( I would like the buy a 55‚Äù ) 

I can‚Äôt think of any way. I‚Äôm not too much geek tech savvy either. 
If it can helps, We have 2 iMac 27‚Äù, 1 MacBook Pro 2012, Apple TV, and that‚Äôs pretty much it.

Secondly, I looked it up, and the thumbsticks were only a problem for a percentage of initial runs. So if you bought four months after release, you probably didn't get one.

The triggers weren't changed until two years later, though. And if yours aren't broken, you either don't use them very often, or you haven't noticed. Which wouldn't be surprising. 

Because it's not like they completely stop working or fall out. They just might stick every now and again, or it might require more pressure to register a button trigger press.

I noticed when mine broke because of these minor details.

HI 've had bought the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless also! Was also running to the stores to buy them, since I would love to have a pair of earphones that were better than Airpods and Bose SoundSport Free...\`  
MTW - I had drops, some hiccups during long music sessions but they had a good sound, detailed, and they were comfortable! The sound isolation is mehhh... nothing compared with Bose sound isolation, Nura isolation, Sony sound isolation and even dash pro sound isolation... I thins they are more passive sound isolation! In the end I returned them because they had the drops and the hiccups... I tried only with my iPhone XS Max... I did not demand for a new pair! though that I should wait!!!

Comparing with Airpods and Bose Sound Sport Free...

Airpods... The sound by the MTW are better, but common is the sound really better? are they worth the 349Swiss Franch against the 159CHF Airpods? Yes they are better! but I thing that they nor worth the difference, but anyway I should try a good pair of MTW to test again... The AirPods are for sure the easier of them to connect, to use, to double Tap to a next song, or pay pause, and you can use one of them to make a call, no matter if it is the right side or the left side... the MTW don do that neither the Bose ... And one more thing... the touch controls on the MTW are annoying... not easy to use and understand...The battery on the Airpods, a almost 2 years old model, has a 5h battery, and a lot more to charge... The MTW gives 4h and 3 more charges...

The Bose, we connect, and we star using them, and they give you a good sound also, not detailed as the MTW but they are good... But they are bulky... ugly... I only have them because I bought with a good discount... and they are really comfortable...The good in them is that we can easily change between devices easily, we can change the source... That misses on the MTW and that is something important... The buttons on the Bose are hard to press...

I loved the sound on the MTW but I did not stayed as impressed as everyone talks on internet...yes I loved the sound, is detailed... but could be a faulty device and maybe could be better...I think that I should be wait a little more and see others reviewers and compare again! I know that Airpods are not good, the sound it is not even close to be as good as Sennheiser, but... the price counts also...

Are the Master &amp; Dynamic MW07 as good... I guess not... some people are complaining about the customer service...and they had some problems...

Lets hope that Sennheiser send out an firmware update... to solve some small problems...

""Afib detection"" is literally EKG analysis. It evaluates the data and classifies the rhythm as sinus or Afib. 

Here's the generic definition the FDA established in the [De Novo clearance](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/DEN180044.pdf):

&gt;Electrocardiograph software for over-the-counter use. An electrocardiograph software device for over-the-counter use creates, analyzes, and displays electrocardiograph data, and can provide information for identifying cardiac arrhythmias. This device is not intended to provide a diagnosis.

That's the scope of what Apple requested clearance for, it's what they provided clinical performance data for, and it's what they received.

Gotcha. I'm not sure that your stance is clear then in your original comment I'm replying to, thus the confusion here. 

The dude you're replying to said ""I think the benefit of this is when it comes with an automatic analysis. Not sure if Apple does this though."" Your reply to him basically reads as a negation of his implied question; you said ""I don't know if there's any software for EKG analysis based on a single lead EKG, which this watch provides.""

I was just pointing out that there definitely is software to perform analysis and classification of single lead EKG data, as the software we're discussing does literally exactly that to classify the rhythm as afib or sinus.

I don't think so, I don't mean literally making a tracing of an ECG. Most 12 lead ECGs will use computer software to interpret the tracing for you, often spitting out results like ""myocardial infarction age unknown"" or ""ST abnormality in lateral leads"". I have read through apple's product information and a lot of the news releases and they all only mention the ability to make a tracing, NOT to analyze it. And they got the ECG tracing ability and Afib detection cleared, I didn't read anything about software for analysis getting cleared. Also, single lead analysis wouldn't be that useful (see below).

The Gemini PDA, the Microsoft Surface, and the Blackberry Key2 exist for a reason. A lot of people are under the mistaken impression that preferences changed throughout the market and everyone is completely happy to use a touchscreen. I used to think that was what happened too, but for some reason none of my old computer nerd friends ever changed their attitudes and fully embraced touchscreens with an attitude much more enthusiastic than depressed resignation. If anything, that old Blackberry crowd got excited whenever someone threw them a bone.

The reality is that before the iPhone, the computing industry along with Blackberries and early smartphones were geared primarily towards more technical users, business and IT professionals that typed a lot of e-mails on the go. 

What happened is that the iPhone drew in an entire new market of people who were never into smartphones or computers before. This new market was very large and clueless about technology, and they found that the iPhone was fun, entertaining, and a more than adequate replacement for a desktop PC as just something to surf the Internet, share photos, and watch videos on. It's kind of like what Nintendo did with the Wii and DS... it managed to draw in a lot of people who were never gamers before, just a couple years before the smartphone industry ate their lunch and took away that new market.

So what happened is that this new market totally dwarfed the old professional market, and we got sidelined because we were no longer the primary source of revenue for mobile tech companies. So we kind of had to learn to ""make do"" with the pedestrian devices designed for people who passively read Facebook, make short texts, play a few casual games, and watch YouTube videos.

The only kinds of companies that even remotely pretend to be attentive to our needs anymore are those still chained to the PC and Corporate IT space for some reason, like Microsoft and Dell. And even they did their best to break out and get some of that Apple/Google money with Windows 8 and the touchscreen monitor push, reluctantly realizing that they were largely ""stuck"" with us as their customers because of their long legacy, bad timing, and failure to understand that people were going to touchscreens for portability reasons rather than because they thought it was better than a mouse.",True,False,0.9767

-iPad Pro or current gen iphone/galaxy for AR
-3D cinemascapes. Imagine 40-60 ft 3D walls that appear to fall away and show you a new world when you put on glasses
-HTC Vive Pro for tethered VR

-Meta 2 is really not good for AR, whatsoever
-Hololens is good, but the field of view absolutely limits the experience. Looking forward to specs on the new version going public to discuss
-Magic Leap is actually quite good. The ability for it to focus AR overlay based on depth really gives the user a sense of presence, but for the cost there needs to be a very compelling reason to use it over a 600 dollar iphone for AR.

And I guess I didn‚Äôt elaborate enough. You‚Äôre right, the XR has an LCD screen, which uses an RGB stripe layout, which is what we normally think of when we think of a subpixel layout. It has the same amount of each subpixel. The OLED displays in the X, XS, and XS Max (as well as Samsung and other android phones) use a pentile display, which uses significantly more red subpixels when compared to green and blue subpixels. The resolution spec of displays that use this layout are based on the red subpixels rather than based on the green or blue, which inflates its true resolution. Because of this, despite having a much higher resolution spec, the XS (and X and XS Max) actually have a very slightly lower green and blue subpixel density than the XR does, but has a much higher red subpixel density. This means the XR actually maintains ‚Äúperfect sharpness‚Äù closer than the OLED iPhones (unless the image is only red).

The reason the XR seems to have such a low resolution display is because it doesn‚Äôt inflate its resolution spec like other phones do.",True,False,0.2161

If you don't have an iPhone to trade in at the Apple store, I recommend getting a 2017 iPhone X over the current Xr. It's pretty much a better phone across the board and you get all the bells and whistles of a true flagship phone.

If you do have a phone to trade in, you can get the Xr starting at $449 and the Xs starting at $699. I'll give you the link to Apple's website with the information if you want to look into the details. Good luck!

3723,a9t2ic,2018-12-26 22:29:30,1545863370,"Yeah, I actually only dove deep into this topic recently, and it‚Äôs pretty interesting. I‚Äôm an audiophile and the whole screen thing reminds me a lot of the pitfalls some audiophiles fall into (bigger number is better, ignoring the greater picture, sighted tests rampant with placebo, etc.)

Another drawback of the pentile display is that your phone has to render all those subpixels the display doesn‚Äôt have, so you‚Äôre rendering at a high resolution, but not getting most of the benefits. But you are getting all the drawbacks, such as reduced battery life, and greater graphical overhead. I‚Äôm honestly surprised some tech news site hasn‚Äôt done a story on it, because it isn‚Äôt exactly a secret.

Another interesting thing I learned from DisplayMate is contrast ratio isn‚Äôt all it‚Äôs cracked up to be for cellphones. In fact, when giving a phone a ‚Äúcontrast rating‚Äù, they don‚Äôt even take contrast ratio into account! Most cell phones are used in lit indoor or outdoor environments, and so overall screen brightness, and screen reflectance (how much light the screen glass reflects) are what make a tangible difference in display contrast. Of course, in dark environments contrast ratio takes over and does make a difference. But for most use cases, the iPhone 7 with its LCD screen actually rates higher than the Pixel 3 XL and its OLED display!

I had a feeling you were talking about the price outside of the US, it sucks so much stuff costs so much more over there.

I‚Äôm surprised the XR gets so much hate, because if you really look at it, it‚Äôs the best bang for the buck iPhone since the SE, and in real world use, is not really all that different from the XS (even the screen!) for hundreds less.
